# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems using recursion and storing the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.

-   **Overlapping Subproblems**Â 
-   **Optimal Substructure**
# Implementation

```python

```

## Optimizations

## Optimized Complexity

>[!Time Complexity]+
