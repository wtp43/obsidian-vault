Html5up.com for the template

Template is modified and served on github pages as a static site.

>  The ADHD brain is dumb in that it tends to ignore dull stuff, the best way to combat this is to try and make stuff interesting. Because when you find something interesting it gets harder to get away from it. So a great way to learn something, is to find a practical application of that concept that interests you, and work backwards from that. So instead of going from: Dull academic looking thing -> dull practice -> Implement something boring -> forget the whole thing.

> You're instead going: Interesting application -> How the  does that even work? -> This makes no sense but it's interesting -> This shit is starting to make sense! -> Hey there's that boring concept from the book!
> 
> In fact trying to understand things through practical applications is almost always better and easier than trying to jsut figure out academia.
