## Story Crafting: Constructing Engaging Behavioural Interview Stories
**Source:** https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/story-crafting-101
### Purpose of Storytelling
- Convey insights about your character
- Showcase problem-solving skills
- Ensure experiences are in sync with the job level
- Underlines cultural fit
### STAR Structure
- **Situation:**
	- Provide context (specific challenge/circumstance). 
	- Give clear snapshot without doing a deep dive
- **Task:**  
	- What was your specific role or responsibility in this situation?
	- Ie: leading a team, solving thorny technical challenge?
- **Action:** 
	- Detail the steps/process you took to address the task
	- Specific but concise highlighting where you demonstrated key competencies, technical prowess, or leadership
- **Result:** 
	- What was the tangible impact of your actions?
	- Did you drive a particular metric/change a process for the better/lead team to an unexpected success?
	- Quantifiable results add weight
### Revealing Character
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:**
	- ie: Show that you're adaptable by recounting a time when you had to pivot in the middle of a project due to unforeseen challenges, illustrating how you navigated the situation and the decisions you mad
- **Avoid Generic Examples:**
	- Offer unique insights (ie: there was a time you had to mediate between two team members with clashing perspectives, leading them to a compromise that benefited the project)
- **Reflect On Your Choices:**
	- Rather than narrating events, discuss your thought process
	- Were you torn between two courses of action?
	- What considerations came into play?
- **Highlight Ethical Dilemmas:**
	- Did you ever face a situation where the easy route and the right route weren't the same?
- **Emphasize Customer-Centric Stories:**
### Ensure Level Appropriateness - **:**
- **Understand Requirements:**
	- Technical Mastery for a junior role vs strategic vision for a senior position
- **Demonstrate Scope:**
	- Reflect on magnitude and complexity of past experiences
	- Junior roles: discuss detailed technical tasks
	- Senior roles: emphasize leadership 
- **Quantify Achievements:**
### Brevity and Precision
Efficiency of your communication is paramount
- **Use Active Voice:**
	- Use I: "I led the team" is more concise and direct than "The team was led by me"
- **Avoid Over-explaining:** 
	- If interviewer needs more information, they'll ask
- **Embrace Pauses:**
	- Don't mistake brevity for hurriedness
	- Take a moment to collect your thoughts before responding
	- This ensures answers are more deliberate and concise

### How to Listen and Respond Effectively
Effective Interviewing is not just answering questions
#### Picking up on Verbal Cues
Most interviewers have a list of questions pre-prepared for the interview. These will be interwoven with follow-up questions.
- ie: If an interviewer stars with "Tell me about the project that you're most proud of.", they could be testing a lot of things: your motivations, technical skills, etc.
	- But if they follow up with "How did you find this project?", they're very likely looking for how you handle ambiguous situations or how proactive you are
- If you misunderstand or fail to catch a cue, your interviewer may repeat a a question or ask for another example
	- These are great opportunities to clarify their intent with a question like "are you looking for more about the conflict?", "do you want an example where I was working independently?"
	- Even if you aren't spot on with your probe, your interviewer will likely correct you where they'd like you to spend time responding
- Pro tip: if the interviewer is speaking slowly and clearly, they may be giving you a hint to do the same
#### Sifting Through Non-Verbal Cues
- **Listen Actively:** fully focus on speaker, avoiding distractions, responding appropriately 
- **Watch the Speaker's Body Language:** Are they leaning in? Nodding? These can be signs that you're on the right track
- **Pay Attention to Tone and Speech Patterns:** These can reveal a lot about what the speaker is really thinking
- **:**
### Non-Verbal Communication 

| Non-Verbal Cue          | What It Communicates      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Maintaining Eye Contact | Confidence, Interest      |
| Good Posture            | Confidence, Attentiveness |
| Smiling Genuinely       | Friendliness, Positivity  |
# My Stories (E3: New Grad)
## Conflict Resolution
Examples should demonstrate 
- Willingness to address conflicts
- Maintain positivity
- Seek support when needed

### Example:
> During college, I was working on a software development project with a diverse team for our capstone course. I found myself in a disagreement with a teammate about the best way to implement a specific feature in our application. We had contrasting ideas about the technology stack to use, and it became apparent that we needed to resolve this issue in order to move forward as a team.
> 
> I made a conscious effort to actively listen to my teammate's concerns, putting my own opinions aside for a moment. By doing so, I gained a better understanding of their rationale for preferring a certain technology, and we were able to identify some common ground. Together, we discussed potential solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each approach, while considering factors like performance, scalability, and maintainability.
> 
> Ultimately, we reached a compromise that satisfied both parties, allowing us to proceed with the project in a collaborative and efficient manner. This experience taught me the value of active listening, empathy, and finding common ground in resolving conflicts. I also learned that open communication and collaboration are essential for a team's success, especially when working on complex software projects, and these skills have continued to serve me well in my professional endeavors.
#### Huawai Example

#### Tetris
- S: During university, I was working on a software development project with a team for an object oriented programming course. 
- T: We 
- A: I made a conscious effort to actively listen to my teammate's concerns, putting my own opinions aside for a moment. By doing so, I gained a better understanding of their rationale for preferring a certain technology, and we were able to identify some common ground. Together, we discussed potential solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each approach, while considering factors like performance, scalability, and maintainability.
- R: 

## Navigating Ambiguity
Examples should demonstrate:
- Resourcefulness
- Adaptability
- Willingness to seek guidance when faced with uncertainty
### Example
> During my internship at Zillow I was assigned to a team working on a new feature for the company's rental product. The project requirements were still evolving, and there was a lot of ambiguity around what the final implementation should look like.
> 
> Faced with this uncertainty, I decided to take a proactive approach. I started by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and identifying the dependencies between them. This allowed me to work on aspects of the project that were less ambiguous while waiting for clarity on other parts.
> 
> When I encountered roadblocks or needed guidance, I wasn't afraid to ask questions and seek help from my teammates and manager. I also attended relevant meetings and discussions, which provided valuable insights into the project's direction and helped me stay informed about any changes.
> 
> By remaining adaptable and resourceful throughout the project, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the development of the new feature, despite the ambiguity surrounding its requirements. This experience taught me the importance of being proactive, adaptable, and willing to seek guidance.

#### Personal Project
- Asking for help and guidance from experienced devs
	- Project structure
	- Caching
#### Ambiguity in Client Requirements: RPM
- Noticing that different reports have different date formatting
- Clarified with managers
- Applied a patch to the formatting
#### Huawei
- Proactive: 
	- Suggesting applications/tools for the image compression project
## Driving Results
Examples should demonstrate:
- Ability to proactively take on new tasks
- Meet deadlines
- Collaborate with teammates to achieve small scale objectives
### Example
> When I was an intern at Uber, I was given the responsibility of implementing a new feature for their mobile app. Despite being new to the team and the technology, I was determined to drive results and make a meaningful impact during my internship.
> 
> To achieve this, I actively sought guidance from my teammates, learned the necessary programming languages, and set realistic goals for myself. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks and diligently tracking my progress, I managed to complete the feature ahead of schedule, earning recognition from my team and contributing to the app's overall success.
> 
> The key here was my proactivity. I went out of my way to learn the technology stack and familiarize myself with the product through documentation and by asking questions. This enabled me to deliver the feature expeditiously.
#### Huawei
- Actively sought guidance from teammates regarding API design
- Learned the necessary programming languages
- Was on a tight deadline to produce a minimal working example for a demo. I managed to complete the feature ahead of schedule
## Growing Continuously
Examples should demonstrate:
- Commitment to personal growth/learning/self-improvement
### Example
> During my time as a student, I was passionate about continuously improving my programming skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. I took advantage of online resources like coding tutorials, blog posts, and webinars to learn new programming languages and frameworks.
> 
> One summer, I decided to challenge myself by participating in a local hackathon. This event pushed me out of my comfort zone, as I had to quickly adapt to new technologies and collaborate with team members to build a functional prototype within a tight deadline. Through this experience, I learned the importance of effective time management, teamwork, and embracing challenges as opportunities for growth.
> 
> Since then, I have continued to seek out opportunities for personal development, including attending industry conferences and joining local coding meetups. These experiences have not only expanded my technical skills but also helped me build a strong professional network and gain valuable insights into the tech industry.
### Stepping out of Comfort Zone Through a Full-Stack Project
- Mostly worked on data science projects implementing data processing and then analyzing said data
- This winter, I decided to challenge myself by building a full-stack project. This pushed me out of my comfort zone as I had  to quickly adapt to front-end technologies and languages. 
- Through this experience, I learned the importance of effective time management, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth  
## Tell me about yourself
> Examples should demonstrate **Growth, Navigating Ambiguity, Driving Results, Resolving Conflicts** 
### Tell me about the project you're most proud of
- Demonstrate growth (learning new technologies)
	- Decided on serving a graphql api because it can save network egress 
	- Cached results to reduce database load
	- The database has hundreds of cols and the user might not need all of them
	- It wasn't entirely needed but it improved my technical skills
	- I enjoyed the technical challenge
- Demonstrate navigating ambiguity
	- Deciding on which backend framework to use
	- Settled on fastapi/python as it would be easier to integrate with machine learning models 
- Describe process
- I didn't know any web development at the time, I had mostly done data processing projects
	- Demonstrate grind/fast learning 
	- Show how you handle ambiguous situations (right route vs easy route)
		- Used graphql even though it wasn't necessary (demonstrate proactiveness)
### Technology Choices
#### React 
#### Postgres vs Nosql
- Needed a relational database
#### Fastapi vs Nodejs
- Integrate ML models
#### What would you change if you had infinite time to work on your project?

#### What were the challenges with deciding how to code/implement deploy your project?


## Other Possible Questions

### Demonstrating Growth 
#### Tell me about a recent day working that was really great or fun
- Growth: opportunity to learn a new technology
- Driving results: gave a self imposed deadline
#### Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and what you learned from it
- Missed some test cases in api development at huawei
- My testing process was not structured
- Learned how to write tests after 

### Driving Results (Ability to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisions under pressure)
#### Tell me about a time when you had to make a fast decision and live with the results
- Took ownership of the situation and found solutions 
- Didn't complain or blame anybody/thing for delays
	- I decided to use a library that converted sqlalchemy to strawberry schema models, to make it easier to maintain the schema and models. Without it, I would have to update the models in two different places every time the database schema changed
	- Documentation wasn't great and there bugs/compatibility issues in the latest release
	- Graphql
### Navigating Ambiguity
#### Tell me about a time you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project 

### Resolving Conflicts
#### Tell me about a person you found most challenging to work with
- What happened when the coworker disagreed with you?
- He would disagree and suggest an entirely different way to do it
- I but my beliefs aside momentarily and actively listened to his concerns
- In the end, I was able to understand his concerns better and reach a well balanced compromise
