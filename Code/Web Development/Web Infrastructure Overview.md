# Building Blocks of a Web Application

There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

- **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- **Data Fetching** - where your data lives and how to get it.
- **Rendering** - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- **Integrations** - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
- **Infrastructure** - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- **Performance** - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- **Scalability** - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- **Developer Experience** - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.


# Serverless Framework

# Monolithic vs Monorepos

# Microservices

# Front-end

## React
- Meta React frameworks
	- Next.js: A React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration ...
- React is a component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application
### Next.js
- Next.js is a complete full-stack framework built on top of React.js. You can use Next.js to create basic blog websites up to full-blown, full-stack applications and APIs.

Next.js is a react server side framework, which some advantages. But its main selling point is that it renders react server side.
It’s also built on top of Nodejs, so you could refer to it as a node js framework as well.
Nodejs on the other hand is a JavaScript runtime, which allows you to run JavaScript outside a web browser and on places like a server.
node is the basis for next, without node there will be no next.
NextJS simply provides an easy way to write server side ReactJS code, and have it rendered on the server and the browser.
