# Building Blocks of a Web Application

There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

- **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- **Data Fetching** - where your data lives and how to get it.
- **Rendering** - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- **Integrations** - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
- **Infrastructure** - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- **Performance** - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- **Scalability** - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- **Developer Experience** - your teamâ€™s experience building and maintaining your application.
