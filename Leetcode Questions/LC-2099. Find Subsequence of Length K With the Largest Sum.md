# Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k`that has the **largest** sum.

Return _**any** such subsequence as an integer array of length_ `k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
**Output:** [3,3]
**Explanation:**
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
**Output:** [-1,3,4]
**Explanation:** 
The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
**Output:** [3,4]
**Explanation:**
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
-   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
-   `1 <= k <= nums.length`

# Implementation
```python
def max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr):
  max_sum , window_sum = 0, 0
  window_start = 0

  for window_end in range(len(arr)):
    window_sum += arr[window_end]  # add the next element
    # slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
    if window_end >= k-1:
      max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
      window_sum -= arr[window_start]  # subtract the element going out
      window_start += 1  # slide the window ahead
  return max_sum
```
