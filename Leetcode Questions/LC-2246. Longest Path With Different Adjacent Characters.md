# Description


# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>The longest path (diameter of tree) is either the longest path or the longest path + second longest path.
>The longest path is not required to go through the current node.
>Run DFS for all children (to update the longest_path) but only update the longest_path including this node if the children does not have the same character.

# Implementation
```python
 def longestPath(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> int:
        children = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(len(parent)):
            children[parent[i]].append(i)

        def dfs(i):
            nonlocal longest_path
            # While examing the children, 
            # We want to keep track of the 2 longest paths 
            # starting from this node, so that we can 
            # compute the longest path going through this  
            # node in the sub-tree rooted at this node.
            max1 = max2 = 0

            for child in children[i]:
	            # dfs still happens even if child has the same character because the child might have a path longer than the current node
                childL = dfs(child)
                if s[child] != s[i]:
                    #update max's using paths from the child
                    if childL > max1:
                        max2 = max1
                        max1 = childL
                    elif childL > max2:
                        max2 = childL

			# the +1 is for using the current node 
            longest_path = max(longest_path, max1+max2+1)

			# we return the longest path including this node
            return max1 + 1

        longest_path = 1
        dfs(0)

        return longest_path
```
