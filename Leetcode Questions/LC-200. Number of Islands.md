Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
**Output:** 3


```python
def numIslands(grid)
	islands = 0
	for i in range(len(grid)):
		for j in range(len(grid[0]):
			if grid[i][j] = '1':
				islands += 1
				dfs(grid, i, j) 
#make sure to mark (i,j) as visited

```
