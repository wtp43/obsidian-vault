# Description
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

-   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
-   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
-   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Iterate two pointers at 2 different speeds. The slow pointer goes through every node while the fast pointer goes through every other node.

# Implementation
```python
def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
	if head is None:
		return False
	slow = head
	fast = head.next
	while slow != fast:
		if fast is None or fast.next is None:
			return False
		slow = slow.next
		fast = fast.next.next
	return True
```
