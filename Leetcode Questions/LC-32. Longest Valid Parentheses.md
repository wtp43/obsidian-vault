# Description

# Brute Force
# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>What is important? Where the last valid open bracket was.
>Thus, we should store the index.
>When we can update the longest valid parenthesis?
>When we have popped an open bracket off the stack.
>How do we know we've popped an open bracket?
>We store the last invalid index before the next opening bracket at the start of the stack.
>Length = j-i+1
>- This is because j and i are indices. We want the length. 

# Implementation
```python

def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
	stack = [-1]
	longest = 0

	for i,c in enumerate(s):
		if c == '(':
			# append the index of an open bracket
			stack.append(i)
		else:
			# we are popping the most recent open bracket
			# length = i - last unused bracket
			stack.pop()
			# if the stack still has open brackets, we can calculate 
			# the length which is i - last unused bracket
			# we know that there cannot be a closed bracket in between because
			# it would have popped the bracket before in
			if stack:
				longest = max(longest, i-stack[-1])
			else:
				# we push i because this is potentially the 
				# index before the next closing bracket
				stack.append(i)

	return longest
```
