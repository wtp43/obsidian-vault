# Description
You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth`query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array containing the answers to the queries_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [3,3,1,4]
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
**Output:** [2,-1,4,6]
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
-   `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
-   `intervals[i].length == 2`
-   `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107`
-   `1 <= queries[j] <= 107`

# Implementation
```python
def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intervals.sort()
        pq = []
        res = {}
        start = 0
        n = len(intervals)
        for q in sorted(queries):
            # push all intervals with a left border <= q
            while start < n and intervals[start][0] <= q:
                i, j = intervals[start][0], intervals[start][1]
                heappush(pq, (j-i+1, j))
                start += 1

            # pop the min border if its right border < q
            while pq and pq[0][1] < q:
                heappop(pq)

            res[q] = pq[0][0] if pq else -1

        return [res[q] for q in queries]

```
