Why does setting starting_station = i+1 once cur_tank < 0 work?

Proof by contradiction:
Assume there is a station 0 < k < N_s


# Implementation
```python
def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
	starting_station = 0
	total_tank = 0
	cur_tank = 0

	for i in range(len(gas)):
		total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
		cur_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
		if cur_tank < 0:
			cur_tank = 0
			starting_station = i + 1
	return starting_station if total_tank >= 0 else -1
```
