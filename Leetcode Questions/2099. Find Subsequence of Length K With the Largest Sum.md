# Description

# Brute Force
# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
> Find K largest numbers (quickselect): O(N) but worst case O(N^2)
> Sort by (nums[i], i) then sort again by the index i and return the largest k elements: O(NlogN)
> Keep a heap of the largest k items (nums[i], i). If cur num is smaller than the top of the heap, continue. If it is bigger, pop the top of the heap and insert the cur num: O(NlogK)


# Implementation
```python
def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        max_sum = cur = 0
        q = []
        for i, e in enumerate(nums):
            if len(q) < k:
                heappush(q, (e, i))
            elif e > q[0][0]:
                heappop(q)
                heappush(q, (e, i))
        res = [i[0] for i in sorted(q, key = lambda x: x[1])]

        return res
```
