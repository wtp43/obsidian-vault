# Description
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100

# Implementation
```python
def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
	p1 = head
	p2 = head

	while p2 and p2.next:
		p1 = p1.next
		p2 = p2.next.next
	return p1
```
