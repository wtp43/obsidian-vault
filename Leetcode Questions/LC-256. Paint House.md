# LC 256. Paint House
There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix costs.

For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 

Example 1:

Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
Example 2:

Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2

# LC 256. Paint House

# Implementation

```python
def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(costs)
        # recurrence relation: 
        # dp[i][j] = min(dp[i], costs[i][j] + min(dp[i])
        dp =[[0]*3 for i in range(2)]
        dp[0] = costs[0]
        for i in range(1,n):
            for j in range(3):
                dp[i%2][j] = costs[i][j] \
                    + min(dp[(i-1)%2][(j+1)%3], dp[(i-1)%2][(j+2)%3])
        return min(dp[(n-1)%2])
