>How is the biggest window made?
>It is the window containing the most number of repeated character (character with the highest frequency) + k other letters


Initialize a hash map to contain characters and their frequencies.

Initially the size of the window is 0, which we consider as valid. Expand the window by moving end pointer forward. We do so until the window becomes invalid.

Every time end moves forward, we update the frequency map of the newly added element. We update maxFrequency. if its frequency is the maximum we have seen so far.

If the current window (r-l+1) - maxf is > k, it means we cannot make any more replacements to increase our string length. We need to increase the start index so we can increase our end index in hopes that the next char increases maxf


If the window is invalid, move the start pointer ahead by one step. Every time start moves forward, we update the frequency of the outgoing element in the map. At this point the size of the window is equal to the longest valid window we have seen so far. 

# Implementation
```python
def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
	count = defaultdict(int)
	res = 0

	l = 0
	maxf = 0
	for r in range(len(s)):
		count[s[r]] += 1
		maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])

		if (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
			count[s[l]] -= 1
			l += 1

		res = max(res, r - l + 1)
	return res
```
