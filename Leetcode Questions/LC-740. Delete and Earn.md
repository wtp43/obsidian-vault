# Implementation
```python
def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        points = defaultdict(int)
        # Precompute how many points we gain from taking an element
        for num in nums:
            points[num] += num
            
        elements = sorted(points.keys())
        two_back = 0
        one_back = points[elements[0]]
        
        for i in range(1, len(elements)):
            current_element = elements[i]
            if current_element == elements[i - 1] + 1:
                # The 2 elements are adjacent, cannot take both - apply normal recurrence
                tmp = one_back
                one_back = max(one_back, two_back + points[current_element])
                two_back = tmp

            else:
                # Otherwise, we don't need to worry about adjacent deletions
                two_back = one_back
                one_back = one_back + points[current_element]

        return one_back
```
