# Iterative Implementation T:O(N) S: O(1)
The 3 components we need are prev, cur, and tmp. We need to store the next link because it is being updated.
```python
def reverseList(self, head):
	prev, cur = None, head
	while cur:
		tmp = cur.next
		cur.next = prev
		prev = cur
		cur = tmp
	return prev
```


# Recursive Implementation T:O(N) S: O(1)
Not tail recursion

```python
def reverseList(self, head):
	if (not head) or (not head.next):
		return head
	# recurse and reverse head.next
	# the last head will then get passed all the way up to the original head
	p = self.reverseList(head.next)
	# set the next node's next as the current node: reversing the link
	head.next.next = head
	# head is now the last node in the reversed link list
	head.next = None
	return p
```

>1 2 3 4 5 6
>At 12345 6
>p = 6
>head.next.next = head 
>This
