Here, we are interested in building our intuition. In other words, our ability to reduce a hard problem to a simpler one.

# Two pointers
## TwoSum: 
Find two elements in an array that sum to the target
- Sort then two pointers
- Or, store the complement in hashset and iterate
- O(n)
## ThreeSum (Reduces to TwoSum): 
Find three elements in an array that sum to the target
- Sort then run TwoSum starting at i+1 for i in range(n)
- Again, hashset the complement
- O(n)
