# Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

-   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = ``[[1,0]]``
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = ``[[1,0],[0,1]]``
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
-   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
-   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
-   All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Use Topological sort to detect cycle. It's important to identify which vertex is the source in each edge.

# Implementation
```python
def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
	def dfs_topsort(node):
		if vis[node] == 2:
			return True
		elif vis[node] == 1:
			return False
		vis[node] = 1
		for neighbor in graph[node]:
			if not dfs_topsort(neighbor):
				return False
		vis[node] = 2
		return True
		
	graph = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
	vis = defaultdict(int)
	
	for i,j in prerequisites:
		graph[j].append(i)

	for i in range(numCourses):
		if not dfs_topsort(i):
			return False
	return True
```
