# Description

# Brute Force
O(n^3)
We can find every possible pair of bars.
i = start of bar, j = left of bar, k = the minimum bar in between i and j used to calculate the area of the rectangle.

# Implementation (Monotonic Stack)
```python
def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        max_area = 0

        for i,h in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > h:
                index, height = stack.pop()
                max_area = max(max_area, (i-index) * height)
                start = index
            stack.append((start,h))

        n = len(heights)
        for i,h in stack:
            max_area = max(max_area, (n-i)*h)

        return max_area
```
