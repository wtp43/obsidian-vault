# Description
In a row of dominoes, `tops[i]` and `bottoms[i]` represent the top and bottom halves of the `ith` domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the `ith` domino, so that `tops[i]` and `bottoms[i]` swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in `tops` are the same, or all the values in `bottoms` are the same.

If it cannot be done, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/14/domino.png)

**Input:** tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tops = [3,5,1,2,3], bottoms = [3,6,3,3,4]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** 
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.

# Intuition

>[!danger]+ Intuition
>Understand the question. To have a valid set of dominos, all dominos must include the number which we want to rotate to. That mean's all dominos must match either the top or bottom of the first domino, otherwise it is not possible. Then brute force by finding the rotations needed to rotate to the top or bottom of the first domino. O(n)

# Implementation
```python
def minDominoRotations(self, tops: List[int], bottoms: List[int]) -> int:
        def check(x):
            rotation_bottoms = rotation_tops = 0
            for i in range(len(tops)):
                if tops[i] != x and bottoms[i] != x:
                    return -1
                elif tops[i] != x:  
                    rotation_tops +=1
	            # elif and not else because both top and bottom could be x and therefore no rotation is needed
                elif bottoms[i] != x:
                    rotation_bottoms += 1
            return min(rotation_bottoms, rotation_tops)
        
        rotations = check(tops[0])
        if rotations != -1 or tops[0] == bottoms[0]:
            return rotations
        return check(bottoms[0]) 
```
