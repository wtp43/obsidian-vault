Generally if you are looking to bet the favorite, take them early. If you are looking to bet the underdog, take them later. For the most part, wherever the public is betting on will be where the line moves.


TRENDS ARE MEANINGLESS (without context). The main reason I say this is that the 2013 Golden State Warriors is not the same team as the 2017 one, teams, lines, players are all different and Vegas definitely accounts for that.
