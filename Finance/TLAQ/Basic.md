# Terminology 
- A basis point is **one-hundredth of a percentage point**. For instance, one basis point equals 0.01%, or 0.0001. One hundred basis points equal 1%.


# Don't do dumb stuff
- Trading too much
- Trading too big
- Trying to be a hero

# Need a Realistic Plan
- Market is highly competitive
- You can't compete on speed or smarts
- You can compete in game selection
- Concentrate on doing useful things in uncompetitive places - just like any other business
	- Helping traders reduce their risk
	- Helping traders to satisfy dumb objectives

# Run it like a business
- You need to have confidence that you are doing things that are likely to make money. Not like drawing lines on charts, throwing price data at neural nets, or immersing themselves in financial media…

# Buy Cheap Sell Rich and Accepting/Managing Risk
- Without some risk, there can be no return
- First, we need to find other traders who are willing or forced to buy from us too cheap or sell to us too rich.
	- Picture the trader with large leveraged positions in a market crash. Risk metrics flashing red, they are forced to sell to cut size. The sellers will be forced to sell at a discount and you will be able to buy cheap if you get to trade them.
- You are in competition with other traders trying to do the same as you, not with those that you're trying to help out.
	- This suggests that we want to be helping those people in as uncompetitive an environment as you can find.
		- This means there's something unattractive about the opportunity
		- Bit murky, labor-intensive/capital-intensive, opportunity is small, low rewards
		- We need to find out why it sucks - because we want to know why we can compete at it
		- **_If you’ve found an opportunity and can’t identify what sucks about it, then you probably haven’t found an opportunity._**

# What is a Good trade
- A good trade isn't one that makes money
- A bad trade isn't one that loses money
- A good trade is one with positive expectation

# Unpredictable Randomness is a defining feature of financial market returns



# Don't be a Hero
- Plan for the worst case scenario
- Try to set things up so you're likely to make money even when you're wrong
- Keep trading strategies simple
- Assume things won't go the way you expect them to
- The more rules and parameters you add to a trading strategy, the more brittle it is likely to be and the less likely it is to be profitable in a range of future outcomes
	- An overly specific implementation of a good idea can lose money even if the core idea is sound
