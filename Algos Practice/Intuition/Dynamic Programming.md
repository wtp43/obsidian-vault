Why sliding window wouldn't work here:
- There is no window of k for our solution
	- The size of k will not encompass all the substrings that a word may contain
	- we need to do more comparisons
- Sorting does not allow us to find the answer in O(1)
	- we realize that we have to check more than just the word at the start of the window
