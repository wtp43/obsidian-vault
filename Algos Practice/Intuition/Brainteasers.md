- [ ] [[LC-1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row]]
- We have to immediately recognize that it doesn't matter where we check but that every single domino must have at least one of the two numbers present.
- So if any domino doesn't have the top or bottom number of the first domino, no rotations are possible
