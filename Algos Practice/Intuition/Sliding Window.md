Check validity of window

## Template 1: Sliding Window (Shrinkable)
- The window is kept valid at the end of each outer for loop
```cpp
int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;
for (; j < N; ++j) {
    // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
    for (; invalid(); ++i) { // when invalid, keep shrinking the left edge until it's valid again
        // CODE: update state using A[i]
    }
    ans = max(ans, j - i + 1); // the window [i, j] is the maximum window we've found thus far
}
return ans;
```

[[LC-1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element]] (Shrinkable Window)
- Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations (increment the element at index i by 1)
- Sliding window problem,  
- the key is to find out the valid condition: 
- `k + sum >= size * max`  
	- if this is true, we can extend the window further
- which is  
- `k + sum >= (j - i + 1) * A[j]`
- window is not valid if (we do not have enough operations to change all numbers into `A[j])
	- sum + k < (j - i + 1) * `A[j]`
- Sort so we can deal with adjacent numbers easily

```cpp
// OJ: https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/
// Author: github.com/lzl124631x
// Time: O(NlogN)
// Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& A, int k) {
        sort(begin(A), end(A));
        long i = 0, N = A.size(), ans = 1, sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            sum += A[j];
            while ((j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum > k) {
	            sum -= A[i++];
            }
            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Template 2: Sliding Window (Non-shrinkable) - faster than shrinkable
- Grow the window when it's valid, shift the window when it's invalid (1 for loop)
- The first valid window is kept constant and moved ahead. If we get any new valid window greater than the existing window then we increment the window length which was kept in the existing loop.
```cpp
// OJ: https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/
// Author: github.com/lzl124631x
// Time: O(NlogN)
// Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& A, int k) {
        sort(begin(A), end(A));
        long i = 0, j = 0, N = A.size(), sum = 0;
        for (; j < N; ++j) {
            sum += A[j];
            if ((j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum > k) sum -= A[i++];
        }
        return j - i;
    }
};
