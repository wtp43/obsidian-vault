## Dp

Dp is about managing states. 
- Use dictionary, arrays


### Bottom up DP 
1. Find recursive relation
	1. Recurse on target (target must thus be outer loop since we are building up answers using target-1)
2. Find base case 
	1. May need to construct extra row for ease of calculation
3. Find edge case
	1. ie: handle impossible cases, input not big enough for target
