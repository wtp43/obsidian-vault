# Chaos Theory
Chaos theory explains the behaviour of dynamic systems like weather, which are extremely sensitive to initial conditions.

## Understanding Chaos Theory
Physics is deterministic. If you know all the properties of a system (system meaning anything from a single particle in a box to weather patterns on the earth) and you know the laws of physics, then you can perfectly predict the future.
- Determinism: You know how the system will evolve from state to state as time marches forward.

It turns out, nature can be both deterministic and unpredictable.
Back in the 1800s, the king of Sweden offered a prize to anyone who could solve the three-body problem.

> Predict the motion of three objects in the solar system that are interacting only through gravity according to Newton's Laws. When there are only two objects, Newton's laws tell you exactly how they will behave well into the future.

French mathematician Henri Poincare highlighted how small differences at the beginning of the system would lead to big differences at the end. 

It wasn't until the mid-20th century that mathematician Edward Lorenz was studying a simple model of Earth's weather found surprising sensitivity to the initial conditions when he stopped and restarted his simulation and saw wildly different results. 

## Chaotic Systems Are Everywhere
A signature sign of a chaotic system is "The Butterly Effect". Normally, when you start a system off with very small changes in the initial conditions, you get only very small changes in the output. This is not the case with weather. A buttery flapping its wings in South America can lead to a giant different in weather (like the formation of a new hurricane in the Atlantic). Another example (stick a pendulum on the end of another pendulum). 

The sensitivity to initial conditions means that with chaotic systems, it's impossible to make firm predictions, because you can never know exactly, precisely, to the infinite decimal point the state of the system. And if you're off by even the tiniest bit, after enough time, you'll have no idea what the system is doing.

## Chaos Theory and the Secrets of Fractals
There are several surprising features buried in this unpredictability and chaos. They appear mostly in something called phase space, a map that describes the state of a system at various points in time. If you know the properties of a system at a specific "snapshot", you can describe a point in phase space. Some systems exhibit a pattern called attractors. This means that no matter where you start the system, it ends up evolving into a particular state that it is especially fond of. For example, no matter where you drop a ball in a valley, it will end up at the bottom of the valley. That bottom is the attractor of this system.

When Lorenz looked at the phase space of his simple weather model, he found an attractor. But that attractor didn't look like anything that had been seen before. His weather system had regular patterns, but the same state was never repeated twice. 

## Contradiction and Strange Attractors
The regular patterned weather system without the repetition of the same state seemed like an obvious contradiction. There was an attractor; i.e., the system had a preferred set of states. But the same state was never repeated. The only way to describe this structure is as a fractal. 

If you look at the phase space of Lorenz's and zoom in on a small piece of it, you will see a tiny version of the exact same phase space. Repeat and you get the same result. Things that look the same the closer you look at them are fractals. 

So the weather system has an attractor, but it's strange. That's why they're literally called strange attractors. And they appear in all sorts of chaotic systems.
